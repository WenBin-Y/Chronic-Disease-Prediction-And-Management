Hello üëãüèº

This project is adapted from my one of my previous university coursework. It is a **proof of concept** that utilised machine learning models to predict chronic illnesses in at-risk patients and then recommend diet and physical activity plans to proactively prevent chronic disease development. This project was awarded an **A+ grade**.

### Understanding This Repository

This repository contains the R files that were used in proving that prediction of 4 types of chronic diseases was achievable to a **high degree of accuracy and recall**. The chronic diseases are: Chronic kidney disease | Diabetes | Dyslipidemia | Hypertension - 4 of the most common types of chronic diseases present in Singapore. 

Should you wish to find out more about the final proof of concept that was proposed, do reach out to me and we can connect via **LinkedIn** üòÅ

In each dataset, the following approach was taken to wrangle the data and prepare it for model training and evaluation:

**Part 1: Data Preparation & Cleaning**

**Part 2: Data Exploration & Selecting Variables**

------- 2.1 Data Visualisation

------- 2.2 Kruskal Test (For Continuous Variables)

------- 2.3 Chi-Squared test (For Categorical variables)

------- 2.4 Selecting Variables


**Part 3: Model Evaluation**

------- 3.1 Train-Test Split & Set Threshold

------- 3.2 Model 1: Logistic Regression w Backward Elimination + Evaluation

------- 3.3 Model 2: CART + Evaluation

------- 3.4 Model 3: Random Forest + Evaluation
